The folder names pattern section asks you for a pattern for your movie folder names. if you don't change the pattern the default will save movies like the example given: 2011 - Melancholia.


Then you must choose an available folder that contains video files with valid movie names. if you like to download icons for your director and movie folders just select the options given.

The "search all subfolders" option will search for movie files through the folder given recursively. 

If everything's fine, the program should start in a command-line like this:

## Download Director Icons
This option will download and set icons for your directors folder. a folder which contains folders with director names.(e.g. Ingmar Bergman)

## Scan Series
Similar to movies mode, this mode will categorize your series videos by episode, season and name. it can download series posters and set them as folder icons.

## Cleaning Windows Cache

if some of your folders stay without icons, you should blame Microsoft Windows caching system. there is a tool for you in Tools menu, on top of the program interface that will require restarting your PC. but it will fix the icons problem.
